# Advent of Code 2025

This is a repository to hold solutions that have been successful in advent of code 2025.

This year I decided to use it to practice Go, while also taking the chance to use a somewhat TDD driven development strategy. So while the solutions might be a bit more verbose than they have to be (including the tests) I felt it would be a good way to work those muscles and see where I'm at.

If you happen to come across this, and want to connect, let me know!

The runnable solutions can be found within the /cmd folder - where each day's solution is in its own folder

If you're interested in doing this yourself, you can checkit out at https://adventofcode.com/2025
