# Advent of Code 2025

This is a repository to hold solutions that have been successful in advent of code 2025.

This year I decided to use it to practice Go, while also taking the chance to use a somewhat TDD driven development strategy. So while the solutions might be a bit more verbose than they have to be (including the tests) I felt it would be a good way to work those muscles and see where I'm at.

If you happen to come across this, and want to connect, let me know!
